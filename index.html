              For years I have been hearing about detective stories. Almost everybody I know seemsto read them, and they
have long conversations about them in which I am un-able to take part. I am always being reminded that the
most serious public figures of our time, from Woodrow Wilson to W. B. Yeats, have been addicts of thisform
of fiction. Now, except for a few stories by Chesterton, for which I did not much care, I have not read any
detective stories since one of the earliest, if not the earliest, of the imitators of Sherlock Holmes—a writer
named Jacques Futrelle, now dead, who invented a character called the Thinking Machine and published his
first volume of sto-ries about him in 1907. Enchanted though I had been with Sherlock Holmes, I got bored
with the Thinking Machine and dropped him, beginning to feel, at the age of twelve, that I was outgrowing
that form of literature.
Since, however, I have recently been sampling the various types of popular merchandise, I have de-cided that
I ought to take a look atsome specimens of this kind of fiction, which has grown so tremendously popular and
which is now being produced on such a scale that the book departments of magazines have had to em-ploy
special editors to cope with it. To be sure of getting something above the average, I waited for new novels by
writers who are particularly esteemed by connoisseurs. I started in with the latest volume of Rex Stout's Nero
Wolfe stories: Not Quite Dead Enough.
What I found rather surprised me and discouraged my curiosity. Here was simply the old Sherlock Holmes
for-mula reproduced with a fidelity even more complete than it had been by Jacques Futrelle almost forty years
ago. Here wasthe incomparable private detective, ironic and ceremonious, with a superior mind and eccentric
habits, addicted to overeating and orchid-raising, as Holmes had his enervated indulgence in his cocaine and
his violin, yet always prepared to revive for prodi-gies of intellectual alertness; and here were the admiring
stooge, adoring and slightly dense, and Inspector Les-trade of Scotland Yard, energetic but entirely at sea,
under the new name of Inspector Cramer of Police Headquarters. Almost the only difference was that Nero
Wolfe was fat and lethargic instead of lean and active like Holmes, and that he liked to make the villains
com-mit suicide instead of handing them over to justice. But I rather enjoyed Wolfe himself, with his rich
dinners and quiet eveningsin his house in farthest West Thirty-fifth Street, where he savors an armchair sadism
that is always accompanied by beer.
The two stories that made up this new book—Not Quite Dead Enough and Booby Trap—I found rather
disappointing; but, astheywere both under the usuallength and presented the great de-tective partlydistracted
from his regular profession by a rigorous course of training for the Army, I concluded that they might not be
first-rate examples of what the author could do in this line and read also The Nero Wolfe Omnibus, which
contains two earlier book-length stories: The Red Box and The League of Frightened Men. But neither did
these supply the excitement I was hoping for. If the later stories were sketchy and skimpy, these seemed to
have been somewhat padded, for they were full of long episodes that led nowhere and had no real business in
the story. It was only when I looked up Sherlock Holmesthat I realized how much Nero Wolfe was a dim and
distant copy of an original. The old stories of Conan Doyle had a wit and a fairy-tale poetry of hansom cabs,
gloomy London lodgings and lonely country estates that Rex Stout could hardly dupli-cate with his
backgrounds of modern New York; and the surprises were much more entertaining: you at least got a room
with a descending ceiling or a snake trained to climb down the bellrope, whereas with Nero Wolfe— though
The League of Frightened Men makes use of a clever psychological idea—the solution ofthe mystery was not
usually either fanciful or unexpected. I finally got to feel that I had to unpack large crates by swallow-ing the
excelsior in order to find at the bottom a few bent and rusty nails, and I began to nurse a rankling con-viction
that detective storiesin general are able to profit by an unfair advantage in the code which forbidsthe reviewer
to give away the secret to the public—a cus-tom which results in the concealment of the pointless-ness of a

good deal of this fiction and affords a protection to the authors which no other department of writing enjoys.
It is not difficult to create suspense by making people await a revelation, but it does demand a certain talent
to come through with a criminal device which is ingenious or picturesque or amusing enough to make the
reader feel that the waiting has been worth while. I even began to mutter that the realsecret that Author Rex
Stout had been screening by his false scents and interminable divagations was a meagerness of im-agination
of which one only came to realize the full ghastliness when the last chapter had left one blank.
I have been told by the experts, however, that this endless carrying on of the Doyle tradition does not
rep-resent all or the best that has been done with the detec-tive story during the decades of its proliferation.
There has been also the puzzle mystery, and this, I was assured, had been brought to a high pitch of ingenuity
in the stories of Agatha Christie. So I have read also the new Agatha Christie, Death Comes as the End, and
I con-fess that I have been had by Mrs. Christie. I did not guess who the murderer was, I was incited to keep
on and find out, and when I did finally find out, I was surprised. Yet I did not care for Agatha Christie and I
hope never to read another of her books. I ought, perhaps, to discount the fact that Death Comes as the End
is supposed to take place in Egypt two thousand years before Christ, so that the book has a flavor of Lloyd
C. Douglas not, I under-stand, quite typical ofthe author. ("No more Khay in this world to sail on the Nile and
catch fish and laugh up into the sun whilst she, stretched out in the boat with little Teti on her lap, laughed back
at him"); but her writing is of a mawkishness and banality which seem to me literally impossible to read. You
cannot read such a book, you run through it to see the problemworked out; and you cannot become interested
in the characters, be-cause they never can be allowed an existence of their own even in a flat two dimensions
but have always to be contrived so that they can seem either reliable or sinister,, depending on which quarter,
at the moment, is to be baited for the reader's suspicion. This I had found also a source of annoyance in the
case of Mr. Stout, who, however, has created, after a fashion, Nero Wolfe and Archie Goodwin and has made
some attempt at charac-terization of the people that figure in the crimes; but Mrs. Christie, in proportion as
she is more expert and concentrates more narrowly on the puzzle, hasto eliminate human interest completely,
or, rather, fill in the pic-ture with what seems to me a distasteful parody of it. In this new novel, she has to
provide herself with puppets who will be good for three stages of suspense: you must first wonder who is
going to be murdered, you must then wonder who is committing the murders, and you must finally be unable
to foresee which of two men the hero-ine will marry. It is all like a sleight-of-hand trick, in which the magician
diverts your attention fromthe awk-ward or irrelevant movementsthat conceal the manipu-lation ofthe cards,
and it maymildlyentertain and as-tonish you, assuch a sleight-of-hand performance may. But in a performance
like Death Comes as the End, the patter is a constant bore and the properties lack the ele-gance of playing
cards.
Still fearing that I might be unjust to a department of literature that seemed to be found so absorbing by many,
I went back and read The Maltese Falcon, which I assumed to be a classic in the field, since it had been called
by Alexander Woollcott "the best detective story America has yet produced" and since, at the time of its
publication, it had immediately caused Dashiell Ham-mett to become—in Jimmy Durante's phrase, referring
to himself—"duh toast of duh intellectuals." But it was difficult for me to understand what they had thought
—in 1930—they were toasting. Mr. Hammett did have the advantage of real experience as a Pinkerton
detec-tive, and he infused the old formula of Sherlock Holmes with a certain cold underworld brutality which
gave readers a new shudder in the days when it wasfash-ionable to be interested in gangsters; but, beyond this,
he lacked the ability to bring the story to imaginative life. As a writer, he is surely almost asfar below the rank
of Rex Stout as Rex Stout is "below that of James Cain. The Maltese Falcon today seems not much above I
those newspaper picture-strips in which you follow from day to day the ups and downs of a
strong-jawed hero and a hardboiled but beautiful adventuress.

What, then, is the spell of the detective story that has been felt by T. S. Eliot and Paul Elmer More but which
I seem incapable of feeling? As a department of imaginative writing, it looks to me completely dead. The spy
story may perhaps only now be realizing its poetic possibilities, as the admirers of Graham Greene contend;
and the murderstory that exploits psychologi-cal horror is an entirely different matter. But the detec-tive story
proper had borne all its finest fruits by the end of the nineteenth century, having only declined from the point
where Edgar Allan Poe had been able to com-municate to M. Dupin something of his own ratiocinative
intensity and where Dickens had invested his plots with a social and moral significance that made the final
solution of the mystery a revelatory symbol of something that the author wanted seriously to say. Yet the
detective story has kept its hold; had even, in the two decades between the great wars, become more popular
than ever before; and there is, I believe, a deep reason for this. The world during those years was ridden by
an all-pervasive feeling of guilt and by a fear of impending disaster which it seemed hopeless to try to avert
because it never seemed conclusively possible to pin down the responsibility. Who had committed the original
crime and who was going to commit the next one?—that sec-ond murder which always, in the novels, occurs
at an unexpected moment when the investigation is well un-der way; which, as in one of the Nero Wolfe
stories, may take place right in the great detective's office. Everybody is suspected in turn, and the streets are
full of lurking agents whose allegiances we cannot know. Nobody seems guiltless, nobody seems safe; and
then, suddenly, the mur-derer is spotted, and—relief!—he is not, after all, a person like you or me. He is a
villain—known to the trade as George Gruesome—and he has been caught by an infal-lible Power, the
supercilious and omniscient detective, who knows exactly where to fix the guilt.</h4>
