             <h4 class="Project2">Three months ago I wrote an article on some recent detective stories. I had not read any fiction of this kind
              since the days of Sherlock Holmes, and, since I con-stantly heard animated discussions of the merits of the
              mystery writers, I was curious to see what they were like today. The specimens I tried I found disappointing,
              and I made some rather derogatory remarks in connec-tion with my impressions of the genre in general. To
              my surprise, this brought me letters of protest in a volume and of a passionate earnestness which had hardly
              been elicited even by my occasional criticisms of the Soviet Union. Of the thirty-nine letters that have reached
              me, only seven approve my strictures. The writers of almost all the others seemdeeply offended and shocked,
              and they all say almost exactly the same thing: that I had simply not read the right novels and that I would
              surely have a different opinion if I would only try this or that author recommended by the correspondent. In
              many of these letters there was a note of asperity, and one lady went so far as to declare that she would never
              read my articles again unless I were prepared to reconsider my position. In the meantime, furthermore, a
              number of other writers have published articles defending the detective story: Jacques Barzun, Joseph Wood
              Krutch, Raymond Chandler and Somerset Maugham have all had something to say on the subject—nor has
              the um-brageous Bernard De Voto failed to raise his voice.
              Overwhelmed by so much insistence, I at last wrote my correspondents that I would try to correct any
              in-justice by undertaking to read some of the authors that had received the most recommendations and taking
              the whole matter up again. The preferences of these readers, however, when I had a tabulation of them made,
              turned out to be extremelydivergent. Theyranged over fifty-two writers and sixty-seven books, most of which
              got only one or two votes each. The only writers who got as many as five or over were Dorothy L. Sayers,
              Margery Allingham, Ngaio Marsh, Michael Innes, Raymond Chandler and the author who writes under the
              names of Carter Dickson and John Dickson Carr.
              The writer that my correspondents were most nearly unanimous in putting at the top was Miss Dorothy L.
              Sayers, who was pressed upon me by eighteen people, and the book of hers that eight of them were sure I
              could not failto enjoy was a story called The Nine Tai-lors. Well, I set out to read The Nine Tailors in the hope
              of tasting some novel excitement, and I declare that it seems to me one of the dullest books I have ever
              en-countered in any field. The first part of it is all about bell-ringing as it is practised in English churches and
              contains a lot of information of the kind that you might expect to find in an encyclopedia article on
              campanol-ogy. I skipped a good deal of this, and found myself skipping, also, a large section of the
              conversations be-tween conventional English village characters: "Oh, here's Hinkins with the aspidistras.
              People may say what they like about aspidistras, but they do go on all the year round and make a background,"
              etc. There was also a dreadfulstock English nobleman of the casual and debonair kind, with the embarrassing
              name of Lord Peter Wimsey, and, although he was the focal character in the novel, being Miss Dorothy
              Sayers's version of the inevitable Sherlock Holmes detective, I had to skip a good deal of him, too. In the
              meantime, I was losing the story, which had not got a firm grip on my attention, but I went back and picked
              it up and steadfastly pushed through to the end, and there I discovered that the whole point was that if a man
              wasshut up in a belfry while a heavy peal of chimes was being rung, the vibra-tions of the bells might kill him.
              Not a bad idea for a murder, and Conan Doyle would have known how to dramatize it in an entertaining tale
              ofthirty pages, but Miss Sayers had not hesitated to pad it out to a book ofthree hundred and thirty, contriving
              one of those hackneyed cock-and-bull stories about a woman who commits bigamy without knowing it, and
              larding the whole thing with details of church architecture, bits of quaint lore from books about bell-ringing
              and the aw-ful whimsical patter of Lord Peter.
              - 2 -
              I had often heard people say that Dorothy Sayers wrote well, and I felt that my correspondents had been
              playing her as their literary ace. But, really, she does not write very well: it is simply that she is more
              con-sciously literary than most ofthe other detective-story writers and that she thus attracts attention in a field
              which is mostly on a sub-literary level. In any serious department of fiction, her writing would not appear to
              have any distinction at all. Yet, commonplace in thisre-spect though she is, she gives an impression of brilliant
              talent if we put her beside Miss Ngaio Marsh, whose Overture to Death was also suggested by several
              corre-spondents. Mr. De Voto has put himself on record as be-lieving that Miss Marsh, as well as Miss Sayers
              and Miss Allingham, writes her novels in "excellent prose," and thisthrowsfor me a good deal of light on Mr.
              De Voto's opinions as a critic. I hadn't quite realized before, though I had noted his own rather messy style,
              to what degree he wasinsensitive to writing. I do not see how it is possible for anyone with a feeling for words
              to describe the unap-petizing sawdust which Miss Marsh has poured into her pages as "excellent prose" or as
              prose at all except in the sense that distinguishes prose fromverse. And here again the book is mostly padding.
              There isthe notion that you could commit a murder by rigging up a gun in a piano in such a way that the victim
              will shoot himself when he presses down the pedal, but this is embedded in the dialogue and doings of a lot
              of faked-up English county people who are even more tedious than those of The Nine Tailors.
              The enthusiastic reader of detective stories will indig-nantly object at this point that I amreading for the wrong
              things: that I ought not to be expecting good writing, characterization, human interest or even atmos-phere.
              He isright, of course, though I was not fully aware of it till I attempted Flowers for the Judge, con-sidered by
              connoisseurs one of the best books of one of the masters of this school, Miss Margery Allingham. This tale
              I found completely unreadable. The story and the writing both showed a surface so wooden and dead that I
              could not keep my mind on the page. How can you care who committed a murder which has never really been
              made to take place, because the writer hasn't any ability of even the most ordinary kind to persuade you to see
              it or feel it? How can you probe the possibili-ties of guilt among characters who all seem alike, because they
              are allsimply names on the page? It was then that I understood that a true connoisseur of this fiction must be
              able to suspend the demands of hisimagination and literary taste and take the thing as an intellectual problem.
              But how you arrive at that state of mind is what I do not understand.
              In the light of this revelation, I feel that it is probably irrelevant to mention that I enjoyed The Burning Court,
              by John Dickson Carr, more than the novels of any of these ladies. There is a tinge of black magic that gives
              it a little of the interest of a horror story, and the author has a virtuosity at playing with alternative hypotheses
              that makes this trick of detective fiction more amusing than it usually is. I want, however, to take up certain
              points made by the writers of the above-mentioned articles. Mr. Barzun informs the non-expert that the
              detective novelis a kind of game in which the reader of a given story, in order to play properly his hand,should
              be familiar with all the devices that have already been used in other stories. These devices, it seems, are now
              barred: the reader must challenge the writer to solve his problem in some novel way, and the writer puts it up
              to the reader to guessthe new solution. This may be true, but I shall never qualify. I would rather play Twenty
              Questions, which at least does not involve the consump-tion of hundreds of ill-written books.
              A point made by three of these writers, Mr. Maugham, Mr. De Voto and Mr. Krutch, is that the novel has
              be-come so philosophical, so psychological and so symbolic that the public have had to take to the detective
              story as the only department of fiction where pure story-telling survives. This seems to me to involve two
              fallacies. On the one hand, it is surely not true that "the serious novelists oftoday"—to quote Mr. Maugham's
              assertion—"have often," in contrast to the novelists of the past, 'little or no story to tell," that "they have
              allowed themselves to be persuaded that to tell a story is a negligible form of art." It is true, of course, that
              Joyce and Proust—who, I sup-pose, must be accounted the heaviest going—have their various modern ways
              - 3 -
              of boring and playing tricks on the reader. But how about the dreadful bogs and obstacles that one has to get
              over in Scott? the interpolated es-says in Hugo? the leaking tap of Thackeray's reflec-tions on life, in which
              the story is always trickling away? Is there anything in first-rate modern fiction quite so gratuitous as these
              longueurs?Even Proust and Joyce and Virginia Woolfdo certainlyhave storiesto tell, and they have organized
              their books with an intensity which has been relatively rare in the novel and which, to my mind, more than
              makes up for the occasional viscosity of their narrative.
              On the other hand, it seems to me—for reasons sug-gested above—a fantastic misrepresentation to say that
              the average detective novel is an example of good story-telling. The gift for telling stories is uncommon, like
              other artistic gifts, and the only one of this group of writers—the writers my correspondents have praised—
              who seems to me to possess it to any degree is Mr. Ray-mond Chandler. His Farewell, My Lovely is the only
              one of these books that I have read all of and read with enjoyment. But Chandler, though in his recent article
              he seems to claim Hammett as his master, does not really belong to this school of the old-fashioned detective
              novel. What he writes is a novel of adventure which has less in common with Hammett than with Alfred
              Hitch-cock and Graham Greene—the modern spy story which has substituted the jitters of the Gestapo and
              the G.P.U. for the luxury world of E. Phillips Oppenheim. It is not simply a question here of a puzzle which
              has .Been put together but of a malaise conveyed to the reader, the horror of a hidden conspiracy that is
              continually turning up in the most varied and unlikely forms. To write such a novel successfully you must be
              able to invent char-acter and incident and to generate atmosphere, and all this Mr. Chandler can do, though
              he is a long way be-low Graham Greene. It was only when I got to the end that I felt my old crime-story
              depression descending upon me again—because here again, as is so often the case, the explanation of the
              mysteries, when it comes, is neither interesting nor plausible enough. It failsto jus-tifythe excitement produced
              by the elaborate build-up of picturesque and sinister happenings, and one cannot help feeling cheated.
              My experience with this second batch of novels has, therefore, been even more disillusioning than my
              expe-rience with the first, and my final conclusion isthat the reading of detective storiesissimply a kind of vice
              that, for silliness and minor harmfulness, ranks somewhere be-tween smoking and crossword puzzles. This
              conclusion seems borne out by the violence of the letters I have been receiving. Detective-story readers feel
              guilty, they are habitually on the defensive, and all their talk about "well-written" mysteriesissimply an excuse
              for their vice, like the reasons that the alcoholic can always pro-duce for a drink. One of the letters I have had
              shows the addict in his frankest and most shameless phase. This lady begins by pretending, like the others, to
              guide me in my choice, but she breaks down and tellsthe whole dreadful truth. Though she hasread, she says,
              hundreds of detective stories, "it is surprising," she finally con-fesses, "how few I would recommend to
              another. However, a poor defective story is better than none at all. Try again. With a little better luck, you'll
              find one you admire and enjoy. Then you, too, may be A mystery fiend."
              Thisletter has made my blood run cold: so the opium smoker tellsthe novice not to mind ifthe first pipe makes
              himsick; and I fall back for reassurance on the valiant little band of my readers who sympathize with my views
              on the subject. One of these tells me that I have underestimated both the badness of detective stories
              themselves and the lax mental habits of those who en-joy them. The worst of it is, he says, that the true addict,
              half the time, never even finds out who has committed the murder. The addict reads not to find anything out
              but merely to get the mild stimulation of the succession of unexpected incidents and of the suspense itself of
              looking forward to learning a sensational secret. That this secret is nothing at all and does not really account
              for the incidents does not matter to such a reader. He has learned from his long indulgence how to connive
              with the author in the swindle: he does not pay any real attention when the disappointing denouement occurs,
              he does not think back and check the events, he simply shuts the book and starts another.
              - 4 -
              To detective-story addicts, then, I say: Please do not write me any more letters telling me that I have not read
              the right books. And to the seven correspondents who are with me and who in some cases have thanked me
              for helping them to liberate themselves from a habit which they recognized as wasteful of time and degrading
              to the intellect but into which they had been bullied by convention and the portentously invoked examples of
              Woodrow Wilson and Andre Gide—to these staunch and pure spirits I say: Friends, we represent a minority,
              but Literature is on our side. With so many fine books to be read, so much to be studied and known, there is
              no need to bore ourselves with this rubbish. And with the paper shortage pressing on all publication and many
              first-rate writers forced out of print, we shall do well to discourage the squandering of this paper that might
              be put to better use.</h4>
